Sanction UI
===========
Sanction UI is a Graphical Interface Rails Engine to sit on top of your Sanction settings, allowing
* easy control and management of your users and permissions.
* a simple one line methodology of redirecting to access denied from any controller in your app
* the ability to implement specialized delegation of permission management, i.e. 
  * super_users can create any other user, no-one else can.
  * my boss/client cannot be deleted.
* User friendly access denied page for known [authenticated] users
* Human friendly description's of the access control system


Dependencies
============
* http://github.com/joegoggins/sanction

App Requirements
================
* You have a globally accessible method, :current_principal, in controllers and views that
  yields an instance of a Sanction principal class.  This is typically your currently
  logged in user loaded via authentication.  It must NOT return nil ever, in that case
  return a blank Principal class. In ApplicationController, you'll want to have something like:
		def current_principal
	    @current_principal ||= AppUser.find_by_internet_id(current_umn_session.internet_id) || AppUser.new
	  end
	  helper_method :current_principal

* All principal and permissionable classes need to specify a method that
  SanctionUi can use to render their "name", see config/initializers/sanction_ui.rb for
  examples.
